Project Overview
This group project integrates the Spotify Web API with a Node.js application to allow users to fetch and display song and artist information. The application features:

Song Search: Users can input a song name to retrieve details such as the artist, song title, album name, and a preview link (if available).
Artist Search from Text File: The application can read a text file containing artist names and fetch their details from Spotify.
Interactive Menu: A user-friendly menu allows users to choose between entering a song name, running the text file command, or exiting the application.
The application demonstrates the use of environment variables for secure API authentication, asynchronous JavaScript for handling API requests, and various Node.js modules for file operations and user input handling.
